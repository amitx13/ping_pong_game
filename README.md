## 🧱 Process

- Creating all the classes and calling it in the Main file as a variable. All the other classes either extend and inherit from one another.

- In each class, the methods were created and gradually filled out as the game progressed.

## 🎊 Things I have learnt

- **I didn't know that you could code something visual in Java**. It was really fun following the tutorial and seeing it slowly built with packages Java already has such as `JFrame`.

- **A stronger foundation in strictly typed language and revising the knowledge I already had in Java.**

- A good refresher on `public`, `static`, `void` and `this` keywords as well as **defining types everywhere! ** A huge difference from JavaScript, but makes a lot of sense to me.
